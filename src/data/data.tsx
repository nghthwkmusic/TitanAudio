  description: `Hacker by day, DJ by night, NGHTHWK (Matt) has been taking the underground scene by storm! 
  Being a Bass Capital baby from Denver, Colorado and now living in Austin, Texas, Matt has a deep understanding 
  of the electronic music scene and how to get the audience going. His passion for music started with the early 
  works of UKF, Circus One, and Mau5Trap, falling in love with Flux Pavilion's remix of Gold Dust and 
  Deadmau5's Strobe. Overtime, Matt's music taste has evolved, following more of the works released on Wakaan, 
  Deep Dark and Dangerous, and Deadbeats labels. As a artist, Matt is known for his crowd control abilities, 
  being able to move a crowd as needed. His genre versitility also plays into this, allowing him to engage a 
  diverse audience and prime them for other artists to follow!`,
